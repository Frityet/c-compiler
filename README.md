# C Compiler Project

This repository contains a minimal scaffold for building a C compiler.

## Building

Run `make` to build the placeholder compiler located in `src/`.
The output binary will be `bin/cc`.

## Testing

Execute `./run_tests.sh` to compile the project and run a simple version check.
